Test bed for testing option framework related research


.pkl are pickel file of pretrained options. In this case, for each room there are two options, one each door. Options are trained using two different approaches, value iteration (voii.pkl), and q-Learning (oii.pkl).

Final aim of the project for to reach room to the right most of enviroment from any room using options.

Final file for the above implementations is use_sviVI.py which used synchronous value iteration over options to achive goal.
